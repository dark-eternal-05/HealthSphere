#HealthSphere

An initiative to simplify the world of healthcare for both doctors and patients both alike. 

One of the most critical needs today is access to good healthcare. Billions around the world, particularly people in the Indian subcontinent, struggle because they do not get proper access to healthcare. Even those with access have a sour experience. We have apps that let us book movie tickets and seats in a jiffy or even find that perfect restaurant! However, finding doctors is still unbelievably tough. Patient records are either maintained in fat files or if they are online, they are often not accessible or understandable. Doctors do not usually have the time to go through all the reports and this may lead to a compromise on the health front.

HealthSphere aims to help with this issue.
